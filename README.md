# Melastom_endemism_Andes

### Description:
This project addresses the endemism of Melastomataceae species in the Northern Andes, South America. It includes:
1. the identification of high endemism areas based on empirical records; 
2. the inference of high endemism areas based on model projections;
3. the estimate of sampling effort over the focal area; 
4. the collector curve over the focal area;<p>

### Methods:
The dataset includes georeferenced occurences from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) and raster layers from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/). 
Model projections were based on the Maximum Entropy algorithm ([MaxEnt](https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent))
