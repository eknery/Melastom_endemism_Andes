# Melastom_endemism_Andes

### Description:
This project addresses the endemism of Melastomataceae species in the Northern Andes, South America. It includes:
1. the identification of high endemism areas based on empirical records; 
2. the inference of high endemism areas based on model projections;
3. the estimate of sampling effort over the focal area; 
4. the collector curve over the focal area;<p>

### Methods:
The dataset includes georeferenced occurences (~30.000) of Melastom species deposited in the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) database by the NYBG. We utilized raster layers from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/) as features of Machine-learning algorithms. Model projections were based on the Maximum Entropy algorithm ([MaxEnt](https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent))

### Main Findings

1) Empirical estimates of species richness over the Northern Andes

2) Projected estimates of species richness over the Norther Andes, based on MaxEnt

3) Sampling effort over the Northern Andes

4) Projectios of species richness per sampling effort. We still have a lot to discover!
